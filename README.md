# Robotics : Aerial Robotics

This repository contains notes and assignment for the University of Pennsylvania/Coursera in the Robotics Specialization: Aerial Robotics. If you are student in this course, please do not plagiarize this work as it violates the Honor Code.

You will find three assignments:

 * Assignment 1 : The goal for this task is develop a PD controller for a quadrotor to control the height.
 * Assignment 2 : Design of a PID controller to follow two trajectory: Line and sine wave trajectory (2D).
 * Assignment 3 : Design of a PID controller for a quadrotor in 3D.


What I learned:

 * Quadrotor Kinematics and Dynamics;
 * Planning and Control for Quadrotors;
 * Introduction to Nonlinear Control.
